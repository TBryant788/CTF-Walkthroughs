Hello! 

My name is Taylor and I have recently decided to make a career change to Cybersecurity with the ultimate goal of becoming a penetration tester. As a little bit of background
about myself, I am currently a B2B Integration Analyst for a national transportation and warehousing company. I have occupied this role for 4.5 years. 
Some day to day responsibilities of this role are server monitoring, certificate management, data feed connections, and credential monitoring. Additional respsonsibilities
that I have that are more cybersecurity related include email monitoring through the KnowBe4 and Mimecast platforms as well as Endpoint, IDS, and IPS monitoring through
several CrowdStrike platforms in conjunction with the company's Information Security Analyst and System Administartors. 

In my free time, I am actively studying for the CompTIA Security+ and PenTest+ as well as completing CTFs. 

For several reasons outlined below, I have decided to start a log of my CTF experiences in order to: 
  1) showcase my independent work, study, projects, and resume for resume building purposes
  2) practice my technical writing skills
  3) to be more active and visible in the industry and hopefully help others in any way that I can
