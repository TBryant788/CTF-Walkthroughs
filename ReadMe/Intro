///December 16, 2022

My name is Taylor and I have recently decided to make a career change to Cybersecurity with the ultimate goal of becoming a penetration tester.

I have decided to start a log of my CTF experiences to 1) showcase my work and learning for my resume, 2) practice my technical writing skills and theoretical knowledge,
and 3) to be more active in the industry and hopefully help others.

For those that may be knew to CTFs and may have stumbled across this repository and use any of my material, I am assuming that you have a Kali Linux setup of your own and
these reports will be written with that in mind.

If you are a recruiter/HR rep that has seen this material, I am always open to new opportunities-please feel free to reach out and let's talk. 

If you feel so inclined, feel free to follow me on the following social media:

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you find some useful information here.

Taylor
